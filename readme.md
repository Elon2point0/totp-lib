## Introduction

TOTP is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. It is commonly used in two-factor authentication systems. This library aims to provide a straightforward implementation in Rust, making it easy for developers to integrate TOTP into their applications.

## Features

- Simple and clean API
- Written in Rust for performance
- Supports WebAssembly (WASM)
- Easy to integrate into existing applications
- Well-documented codebase

## Getting Started

To start using the TOTP Library, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Elon2point0/totp-lib/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up the library in your project.

## Usage

After downloading, you can easily integrate the TOTP Library into your Rust application. The library provides essential functions to generate and verify TOTP codes. 

### Installation

To install the TOTP Library, clone the repository or download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Elon2point0/totp-lib/releases). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elon2point0/totp-lib.git
cd totp-lib
cargo build
```

### Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the TOTP Library:

```rust
use totp_lib::TOTP;

fn main() {
    let secret = "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"; // Example secret
    let totp = TOTP::new(secret);

    let code = totp.generate();
    println!("Your TOTP code is: {}", code);

    let is_valid = totp.verify(&code);
    println!("Is the code valid? {}", is_valid);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to generate a TOTP code and verify it. You can modify the secret key as needed.
